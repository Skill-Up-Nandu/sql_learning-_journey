# SQL_Learning-_Journey
A complete record of my SQL learning journey — includes notes, practice queries, and mini-projects.

## 🗓️ Day 1 Learning – SQL Basics

On Day 1, I focused on learning and practicing the foundational concepts of SQL:

### 🔹 Topics Covered
- **DDL Commands**: `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`
- **DML Commands**: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- **Constraints**: `PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, `NOT NULL`
- **Filtering with WHERE clause**
- **LIMIT clause** for restricting results

### 🧠 What I Practiced
- Created and populated tables: `students`, `employees`, `books`, and `customers`
- Used `WHERE` clause with various conditions
- Applied constraints in table creation
- Limited output using `LIMIT` for specific queries
