-- 1. Find the total order amount per customer.

SELECT customer_id , count(*) AS total_order
FROM orders 
GROUP BY customer_id ;

-- 2. Count how many orders were placed from each city.

SELECT city , count(*) AS total_order
FROM orders
GROUP BY city ;

-- 3. List cities with more than 2 orders (use HAVING).

SELECT city , count(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY city
HAVING count(*) > 2 ;

-- 4. Get the customer who placed the highest total order amount.

SELECT customer_id , sum(amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
limit 1 ;
